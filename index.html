            <p>Thank you for everything.
                Thank you for putting color into my life when I only saw it in shades of gray.
                That decade with you shaped the backbone of my teenage years and the very start of my twenties.
                You are not just someone I loved — you are a part of me, a part of my personality now.</p>

            <p>I see it so clearly, too late. I was selfish, blind, and often cruel without even meaning to. I was a
                narcissist — I put myself before you, and the worst part is, you still put me first. From the days of
                high school until now, you stood by me. You sacrificed. You gave. You let me dictate your life, and I
                see now how unfair that was. I blamed you for things you couldn't control, I projected my faults onto
                you, and still, you loved me with a heart so kind that my flaws never mattered to you. You just saw me —
                and that was more than I ever deserved.</p>

            <p>I am stupid to realize all of this only now. But I have to say it: I was unfair to you. Always. I lied, I
                hid things, I even gaslighted you. It shows just how broken I was, how trash of a person I became. And
                yet, you stayed.</p>

            <p>
                I’m sorry that I didn’t take you seriously sometimes, that I avoided serious conversations.
                I didn’t know what to say, and I was afraid of saying the wrong things, knowing my history and my mouth.
                I’m sorry I wasn’t serious about setting up our selfies, about the little things that mattered to you.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thank you for helping me how to dress, how to approach people in public, even simple things like riding
                the jeepney.
                You made me a better person.
                And yet, I kept holding myself — and eventually us — back.
            </p>

            <p>You are beautiful. Please don't ever change a thing about yourself, especially not for another person.
                You are perfect the way you are — and I hope you never forget that. Whoever will have you next will be
                the luckiest person alive.</p>

            <p>I want to be honest, too. Yes, I've felt little things for someone else, but they are nothing compared to
                what I had with you. They don't carry the weight of our years, the depth of your sacrifices, or the love
                that shaped me into who I am. The truth is, I'll probably spend the following years reflecting on us, on
                the time we shared, and on becoming better — for myself, and for the man you once believed in.</p>

            <p>I know your mind is set, that you don't want me anymore. And maybe I have no right to ask for another
                chance. But hear me when I say this — I will improve as a person. You said not in the near future, but
                maybe, someday… I'll be able to make it up to you.</p>

            <p>I was always so quick to count the money you owed me, but never once did I acknowledge the deeper debt I
                owe you — the years of sacrifice, patience, and love you poured into me. That is a debt I can never
                repay, but one I will always carry with me.</p>

            <div class="special-message">
                <img src="images/IMG_2365.JPEG" alt="Wonderwall" class="wonderwall-image">
                <p>You've always been my wonderwall — the person who stood in front of me, holding me up when I didn't
                    even deserve it. And that's something I'll carry with me forever.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Whatever happens in the future, I only hope that one day, we cross the same bridge again. And if that day
                comes, may it not be the same ending this time.</p>

            <p>Thank you… and I'm sorry.</p>
